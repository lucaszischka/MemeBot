[Another user replies with "!promote"]
    ↓ 
[Bot validates image and cooldowns]
    ↓
[Bot forwards image to promotion server] → [Promotion server displays image]
    ↓

```

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- A running [Maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) server
- Matrix account for the bot
- External server to receive promoted images

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** the latest `.mbp` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/lucaszischka/MemeBot/releases) or [build from source](DEVELOPMENT.md)
2. **Upload** the plugin file to your Maubot server via the web interface
3. **Create a new instance** with your bot's Matrix credentials
4. **Configure** the plugin settings (see configuration section below)
5. **Invite the bot** to your Matrix rooms and start promoting images!

### Server API Requirements

Your promotion server should accept HTTP POST requests with the following specification:

```
POST {promotion.server_url} # Config value
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {promotion.api_token} # Config value

Body:
- image: [binary image data]
- filename: [original filename or "meme" if not available]
- content_type: application/octet-stream
```

**Expected Response:**
- `200 OK`: Image successfully processed
- `4xx/5xx`: Error (bot will report failure to user)

## ⚙️ Configuration

| `commands` | Available promotion commands | `["!promote", "!p"]` | Yes |
| `promotion.server_url` | Target server for image uploads | - | Yes |
| `promotion.api_token` | Authentication token for server | - | No (`""`) |
| `cooldowns.global` | Global cooldown between any promotions (seconds) | `60` | No (`0`) |
| `cooldowns.user` | Per-user cooldown between promotions (seconds) | `90` | No (`0`) |

> 📝 **Note**: All user-facing messages are in German and can be fully customized in the configuration.
