## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- A running [Maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) server
- Matrix account for the bot
- External server to receive promoted images

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** the latest `.mbp` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/lucaszischka/MemeBot/releases) or [build from source](DEVELOPMENT.md)
2. **Upload** the plugin file to your Maubot server via the web interface
3. **Create a new instance** with your bot's Matrix credentials
4. **Configure** the plugin settings (see configuration section below)
5. **Invite the bot** to your Matrix rooms and start promoting images!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure the plugin through your Maubot web interface:

| Setting | Description | Default | Required |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `auto_join` | Automatically join rooms when invited | `true` | Yes |
| `commands` | Available promotion commands | `["!promote", "!p"]` | Yes |
| `promotion.server_url` | Target server for image uploads | - | Yes |
| `promotion.api_token` | Authentication token for server | - | No (`""`) |
| `cooldowns.global` | Global cooldown between any promotions (seconds) | `60` | No (`0`) |
| `cooldowns.user` | Per-user cooldown between promotions (seconds) | `90` | No (`0`) |
| `image.maximum_file_size_bytes` | Maximum image file size | `10485760` (10MB) | Yes |
| `image.allowed_image_formats` | Supported image formats | `["PNG", "JPEG", "JPG", "GIF", "WEBP"]` | Yes |
| `messages.reply_in_thread` | Bot replies in threads vs. main chat | `true` | Yes |

> üìù **Note**: All user-facing messages are in German and can be fully customized in the configuration.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: If your promotion server is publicly accessible on the internet, always configure an API token! Without authentication, anyone could spam your server with images. üåçüîì

For complete configuration options and their default values, see [`base-config.yaml`](base-config.yaml).

### üåê Server API Requirements

Your promotion server should accept HTTP POST requests with the following specification:

```
POST {promotion.server_url} # Config value
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {promotion.api_token} # Config value

Body:
- image: [binary image data]
- filename: [original filename or "meme" if not available]
- content_type: application/octet-stream
```

**Expected Response:**
- `200 OK`: Image successfully processed
- `4xx/5xx`: Error (bot will report failure to user)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Plugin not responding** | ‚Ä¢ Check instance status in Maubot web interface<br>‚Ä¢ Verify bot has proper room permissions<br>‚Ä¢ Check maubot server logs |
| **Encryption issues** | ‚Ä¢ Test with unencrypted images first<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure bot has access to room keys<br>‚Ä¢ Check encryption setup in maubot |
| **Auto-join not working** | ‚Ä¢ Verify `auto_join: true` in configuration<br>‚Ä¢ Check bot's Matrix account permissions<br>‚Ä¢ Review server logs for join attempts |
| **Images not uploading** | ‚Ä¢ Verify promotion server URL and API token<br>‚Ä¢ Check server logs for connection errors<br>‚Ä¢ Test server endpoint manually |
